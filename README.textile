Want to try your hand at sorting algorithms?  Need a place to test out
your latest sorting function?  Sort Bench is a simple program which you
can use to easily test and benchmark your algorithm.  You can use one of
the included algorithms as a benchmark standard, as well.

Sort Bench includes a few test case files, which can be helpful when
